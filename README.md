# Roguelike in JS

Browser based exploration game in javascript. 

Keeping each iteration of the game in it's own directory.

* `part1/` - WTF is a roguelike, and how does one roguelike.
* `part2/` - How can I add more features to my roguelike. Basic interface, inventory, cleaner code.
* `part3/` - Refactor to separate files. Add multiple scenes.
